<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year Master's student in **Software Engineering** at **Peking University**. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from **Wuhan University**.

My research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**. Recently, I have been focusing on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and VLMs, as well as optimizing tool-calling capabilities and accuracy.

# 📖 Educations
- *2023.09 – Present*: Master's student in Software Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Weiping Li at **Peking University**.
- *2019.09 – 2023.07*: Bachelor of Engineering, School of Electronic Information, **Wuhan University**.

# 💻 Internships
- *2024.01 – 2024.05*, [NIO Shanghai](https://www.nio.cn/), China.  
  Contributed to the development of the LLM framework **BI Agent**, primarily responsible for intent understanding, task routing, and reasoning using LLMs.  

- *2025.04 – 2026.01*, [Baidu](https://ir.baidu.com/company-overview), China.  
  During the summer internship, I received the Xinghai Talent Program. I participated in the pre-training of **Search LLM** and the reinforcement learning post-training of **Query Rewriting LLM**. My main focus was on compressing LLM chain-of-thought to reduce the inference time of the query rewriting LLM.

- *2026.01 – present*, [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/about), China.  
  I received the **Top Campus Talent Program** from **Xiaomi's LLM team** during the fall recruitment. I will participate in optimizing the reinforcement learning training strategies for **DeepResearch** and **GUI Agent** during my internship and full-time employment.
